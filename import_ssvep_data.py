import_ssvep_data.py

This file serves as the module script for BCI Spring 2024 Lab 03. Below, several functions are defined with the ultimate goals of loading and plotting SSVEP data in both the time and frequency domains. load_ssvep_data() allows the user to load in all data relevant to this lab, the return of which is utilized across multiple of the remaining functions. The plot_raw_data() function plots aspects of the data, such as EEG, in the time domain, as well as identifies the frequency of the sample. epoch_ssvep_data() isolates fragments of the data based on periods of time in which the sample is experiencing a 12Hz or 15Hz trial. Finally, get_frequency_spectrum() and plot_power_spectrum() are two functions that are used to convert the aforementioned data into the frequency domain and plot it.

Useful abbreviations:
    EEG: electroencephalography
    SSVEP: steady-state visual evoked potentials
    fs: sampling frequency
    FFT: Fast Fourier Transform
